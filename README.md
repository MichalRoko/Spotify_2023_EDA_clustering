# Spotify's 2023 Top Songs EDA and genres creation using K-Means clustering
## Project objective:
* The goal of this project was to explore and analyze the attributes of Spotify's Top Songs of 2023 and also to use K-Means clustering algorithm to create music genres based on the song's audio features.
* The project consists of the Exploratory Data Analysis section as well as K-Means clustering algorithm and PCA visualization section.
## Created genres:
* **Cluster 0:** dance pop genre.

* **Cluster 1:** acoustic ballads/folk genre.

* **Cluster 2:** rap/hip-hop genre.

* **Cluster 3:** pop/pop-rock genre.
## Final conclusions:
In this project, I analyzed Spotifyâ€™s Top Songs of 2023 to understand patterns in their audio and non-audio features. I used K-Means to group songs into genres and visualized the results with PCA, which allowed me to see the relationships between the songs in a better way.
Through this project I learned more about the K-Means algorithm and the process of choosing the right K-value. I also learned more about PCA and its ability to simplify many-dimensional data, making it more interpretable for analysis and visualization.
